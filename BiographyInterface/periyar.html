            <ul>
                <li>Erode Venkatappa Ramasamy, also known as "Periyar," was born on September 17, 1879 in Erode, which
                    was then part of the Coimbatore district of the Madras Presidency. He was born into a Kannada Balija
                    merchant family, and his parents were Venkatappa Nayakar and Chinnathayee.</li>
                <br>
                <li>He had one elder brother named Krishnaswamy, and two sisters named Kannamma and Ponnuthoy.</li>
                <br>
                <li>He was married at the age of 19 and had a daughter who unfortunately passed away after just 5
                    months. His first wife, Nagammai, died in 1933. He remarried in July 1948 to his second wife,
                    Maniammai, who continued his social work after his death in 1973. Ramasamy's ideas were further
                    promoted by Dravidar Kazhagam.</li>
                <br>
                <li>At the First Provincial Self-Respect Conference of Chengalpattu in 1929, he made the decision to
                    delete his caste title Naicker from his name. He was proficient in two Dravidian languages, Kannada
                    and Tamil. After attending school for five years, he joined his father's trade at the age of 12. He
                    often welcomed Tamil Vaishnavite gurus into his home to give discourses.</li>
                <br>
                <li>As a young man, he began to question the contradictions in Hindu mythological stories. He believed
                    that people used religion as a tool to deceive others, and he felt it was his responsibility to warn
                    people against superstitions and priests.</li>
                <br>
                <li>In 1939, E.V. Ramasamy became the head of the Justice Party, and in 1944, he changed its name to
                    Dravidar Kazhagam</li>
                <br>
                <li>The party later split with one group led by C. N. Annadurai forming the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam
                    (DMK) in 1949. While continuing the Self-Respect Movement, he advocated for an independent Dravida
                    Nadu (land of the Dravidians).</li>
                <br>
                <li>Periyar and his followers campaigned constantly to influence and pressure the government to take
                    measures to remove social inequality,(abolish untouchability, manual scavenging system etc) even
                    while other nationalist forerunners focused on the struggle for political independence.</li>
